// Binding-aware button prompt icons.
//
// The game draws each prompt from a fixed texture, so a shipped replacement can
// only ever show one device's icon. This module instead registers, at runtime,
// the icon for the input actually bound to each prompt's action, so rebinding a
// key or mouse button is reflected in game. The icons are pre-rendered per
// input by tools/make_prompt_glyphs.py into <textures>/bindings/.
//
// A keyboard follows the key bindings and a pad follows its button mapping. The
// icons are registered above the static per-device set, which stays in place
// for any prompt the module has no icon for.
namespace PortPrompts {

// PortTextures::PadDeviceName), or the touch overlay's layout ("xbox" or
// "gamecube"). MP2_TEXTURE_DEVICE overrides it. Both the prompts and the static
// texture set follow this.
